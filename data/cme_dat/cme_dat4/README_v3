files named CME_###_param_inv.csv contain the results from the DBM inversion for each event. Column entries are:
Solar wind speed w in km/s
drag parameter gamma in km^-1
initial speed in km/s
arrival speed in km/s
Travel time in hours
Initial distance for all events is set to 20 Solar Radii

Some details:

Events # 0 18 34 77 106 124 164 199 209 213 did not produce any results for the following reasons:
- events # 0 77 199 213 are excluded from statistical inversion as the error on velocity from the fitting procedure was too large (dv/v > 1).
notice that apart form event #77 they were also analytically invertible.
- remaining events # 18 34 106 124 164 209 did not produce any statistical inverson at all.
